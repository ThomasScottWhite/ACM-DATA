# Getting Started With ACM Data

post this in discord before meeting.

In order to participate in ACM data all you will need to bring is an internet connected device (Ideally a laptop) Our meetings will be on wednesday at 5pm in room 214. Project workshops will be held on saturdays at x time at x place.

Make sure to talk to the cs department about reserving a room every day.

this meeting will cover what data is, the different types of data, and the basics of data science, engineering and ML, ideally there is a small jupyter notebook example which is shown

# Introductory Data Analysis

This lecture is to give them experience with handleing tablular data using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and seaborn, as well as Data cleaning, and some data analysis.

# Data Preprocessing

    Maybe skip this for now or throw this up to the lecture above

# Introduction to Supervised Learning

This lecture is to introduce the students to the basics of supervised learning and its components, through linear regression and classification with pytorch.

    Linear Regression
        Simple and multiple linear regression, assumptions, model evaluation
    Regularization Techniques
        Ridge, Lasso

    Logistic Regression
        Binary and multiclass classification, evaluation metrics
    Decision Trees and Random Forests
        Concepts, overfitting, pruning

# NN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, Transformers

Week 9: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

    Introduction to Neural Networks
        Perceptron, feedforward neural networks
    Deep Learning Frameworks
